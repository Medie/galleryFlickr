# Application Name

## Description

This application fetches images from an API and displays them on a webpage. Users can load more images by clicking a "Show More" button. The backend of this application is a Node.js server built with Express.js. It serves the API that the frontend uses to fetch images.

## Installation

2. Install the backend dependencies:

cd ../backend
npm install

Running the Application
To run the application, you need to start the backend server and then open the frontend in your browser.

Start the backend server:
cd backend
npm start

Usage
The application fetches images from an API and displays them on the page. When the page is first loaded, it fetches a set of images and displays them. The user can load more images by clicking the "Show More" button.

The getImages function (lines 44-68 in script.js) is responsible for fetching the images and updating the page. It creates an image element for each image and appends it to the main element. If there's an error fetching the images, it displays an error message on the page.

The form's submit event and the "Show More" button's click event both trigger the getImages function. When the form is submitted, it resets the page number to 1 and fetches the first set of images. When the "Show More" button is clicked, it fetches the next set of images.

The backend server provides an API endpoint at /api/images that returns a list of images. The frontend fetches data from this endpoint to display images on the webpage.
