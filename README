Usage
The application fetches images from an API and displays them on the page. When the page is first loaded, it fetches a set of images and displays them. The user can load more images by clicking the "Show More" button.

The getImages function (lines 44-68 in script.js) is responsible for fetching the images and updating the page. It creates an image element for each image and appends it to the main element. If there's an error fetching the images, it displays an error message on the page.

The form's submit event and the "Show More" button's click event both trigger the getImages function. When the form is submitted, it resets the page number to 1 and fetches the first set of images. When the "Show More" button is clicked, it fetches the next set of images.
